# Generate drag conductivity values
sigmaDloop.m is used to generate drag conductivity values as a function of the layer densities. 
Read comments in said code for details.
sigmaDloop.m is in submitted via submit.sh to a cluster so that the data points can be worked out simultaneously in different jobs on the cluster.

For simplicity, we use energy-independent scattering time.
